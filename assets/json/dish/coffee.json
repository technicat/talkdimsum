        "description": "Coffee is not exactly a traditional dim sum drunk, but it's a common offering with Hong Kong breakfasts and lunches, particularly at Hong Kong-style cafes ([cha chaan teng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cha_chaan_teng)).\n\n**Ordering**\n\n[杯](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%9D%AF) is *cup* (or mug or glass) and is the [measure word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_word) for water (and other drinks), and [一](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E4%B8%80) means *one*, so to order a cup of coffee, ask for 一杯咖啡 (yāt būi ga fē in Cantonese, yī bēi kā fēi in Mandarin), *one cup of water*.\n\n**Characters**\n\nThis is a [loanword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loanword) -- the pronunciation (ga fē in Cantonese, kā fēi in Mandarin) sounds more or less like *coffee*.\n\n The first character [咖 ](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/咖) is similarly used in the [loanword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loanword) for curry, 咖喱 (ga lēi).",
