And *potsticker* was coined by Chinese-American physician and author [Buwei Yang Chao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buwei_Yang_Chao) (along with the term *stir-fry*) in the classic [How to Cook and Eat in Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Cook_and_Eat_in_Chinese)\n\n**Characters**\n\n[鍋](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%8D%8B) is *pot* (the cookware), and [貼](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%B2%BC) is *stick*, so, yeah, [鍋貼](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%8D%8B%E8%B2%BC) does mean *potstickers*.",
