    "description": "[Peking duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_duck) is roasted duck known for its crispy skin, sliced and wrapped (by you, the diner) in thin pancakes along with garnishes like spring onion and hoisin or plum sauce. Sometimes thick bao wrappers are used instead of the pancakes.\n\n**History**\n\nThis dish is a favorite of Chinese royalty dating back to the Ming Dynasty and in more modern times served to visiting dignitaries such as Henry Kissinger (in between [war crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trial_of_Henry_Kissinger)).\n\n**Characters**\n\n[北京](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%8C%97%E4%BA%AC) is *Peking* (which kind of sounds like the Cantonese pronunciation *bāk gīng*, but *Beijing* as it is now spelled is better matched to its Mandarin pronunciation). [烤](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%83%A4) is *roast*, and [鴨](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/鴨) is *duck*, so [北京烤鴨](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%8C%97%E4%BA%AC%E7%83%A4%E9%B4%A8) is *Peking roast duck* (or *Beijing roast duck*).",
