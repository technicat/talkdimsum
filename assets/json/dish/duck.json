Sometimes thick [bao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baozi) wrappers are used instead of the pancakes.\n\n**History**\n\nThis dish is a favorite of Chinese royalty dating back to the Ming Dynasty and in more modern times served to visiting dignitaries such as Henry Kissinger (in between [war crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trial_of_Henry_Kissinger)).",
