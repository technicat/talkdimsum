        "Description": "Oolong is a brown tea. The leaves are slightly fermented. The caffeine content is moderate, less than that of black tea but more than green tea.\n\nThe first two characters 烏龍 mean “black dragon“ and the third character 茶 is “tea.” so this is “black dragon tea.” “Oolong” (烏龍 wu lùhng) rhymes with the name of the peninsula area of Hong Kong, “Kowloon” (九龍 gáu lùhng). That second character 龍 is also the first character for lobster (龍蝦 lùhng hā).\n\nThere are a few origin stories for the name. One is that oolong tea evolved from a Dragon-Phoenix tribute tea and later renamed Black Dragon. Another theory for the name is that oolong tea first existed in the Wuyi Mountains region. Another story is that the tea was discovered by a man named Wu Liang, who accidentally let the tea leaves ferment (after getting distracted by a deer).",
