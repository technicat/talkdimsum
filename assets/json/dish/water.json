[氵](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%B0%B5) is the left radical form of this character, so if you see a character with that on the left, chances are it has something to do with water or liquid, e.g. [酒](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%85%92) *liquor*, [油](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/油) *oil* (the edible kind) or *sauce*, [海](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%B5%B7) *ocean*, and [清](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%B8%85) *soup*.\n\n**Ordering**\n\n[杯](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%9D%AF) is *cup* (or mug or glass) and is the [measure word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_word) for water (and other drinks), and [一](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E4%B8%80) means *one*, so to order a glass of water, ask for 一杯水 (yāt būi séui in Cantonese, yī bēi shuǐ in Mandarin), *one cup of water*.",
