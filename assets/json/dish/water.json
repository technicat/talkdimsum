      "description": "The glyph origins of {水} resemble a flowing stream. {氵} is the left radical form of this character, so if you see a character with that on the left, chances are it has something to do with water or liquid, e.g. {酒} *liquor*, {油} *oil* (the edible kind) or *sauce*, {海} *ocean*, and {清} *soup*.\n\n**Ordering**\n\n{杯} is *cup* (or mug or glass) and is the [measure word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_word) for water (and other drinks), and {一} is *one*, so to order a glass of water, ask for 一杯水 (yāt būi séui in Cantonese, yī bēi shuǐ in Mandarin), *one cup of water*."
