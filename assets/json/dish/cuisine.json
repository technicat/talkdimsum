Dim Sum by Janice Wong and Ma Jian Jun presents recipes for traditional and new dim sum with a focus on the flour used in the wrappings. The [Nom Wah Cookbook](https://nomwah.com/cookbook/) by Wilson Tang features recipes from the Nom Wah Tea Parlor, a New York Chinatown institution, and profiles the immigrants and their descendants who've kept multi-generational businesses alive in Chinatown.\n\n**Books for Kids**\n\n[Dim Sum for Everyone!](https://gracelin.com/dim-sum-for-everyone/) by Grace Lin is an illustrated dim sum family outing. Dim Sum Time by Sin Siu Tang and Andrew Sun teaches Cantonese dim sum phrases.\n\n**Characters**\n\n[點](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%BB%9E) is *a bit* or *a touch*, and [心](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%BF%83) is *heart* (the character looks like a heart), so [點心](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%BB%9E%E5%BF%83) can be translated as *a bit of heart* or *a touch of heart* or *touching the heart* (Grace Young in [The Breath of a Wok](https://www.graceyoung.com/cookbooks/cookbook-2/) translates it as *a dot on the heart*). Anyway, the origin of the term is debated.\n\n**Related words**\n\n[點](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%BB%9E) is also the first character in *why* ([點解](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%BB%9E%E8%A7%A3) dím gáai) and *o'clock* [點鐘](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%BB%9E%E9%90%98). [心](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%BF%83) is also the second character in *be careful!* ([小心](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%B0%8F%E5%BF%83) síu sām), *happy* ([開心](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%96%8B%E5%BF%83) hōi sām) and the vegetable *choy sum* ([菜心](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%8F%9C%E5%BF%83) choi sām).",
