    "description": "[Taro cake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taro_cake) is similar to [turnip cake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnip_cake) 蘿蔔糕 (lò baahk gōu) but made with taro mixed with rice flour and tidbits like Chinese sausage. It's cut into squares and steamed or pan-fried.\n\nTaro cake is sometimes known as *yam cake* in Malaysia and Singapore, but it's not yam as in sweet potatoes, it's really taro.\n\n[芋頭](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%8A%8B%E9%A0%AD) means *taro*, and [糕](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%B3%95) is *cake*, so [芋頭糕](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%8A%8B%E9%A0%AD%E7%B3%95) is *taro cake*.",
