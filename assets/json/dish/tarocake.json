    "description": "Similar to turnip cakes 蘿蔔糕 (lò baahk gōu) but made with taro mixed with rice flour and tidbits like Chinese sausage. It's cut into squares and steamed or pan-fried.\n\nTaro cake is sometimes known as “yam cake” in Malaysia and Singapore, but it's not yam as in sweet potatoes, it's really taro.\n\n[芋頭](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/芋頭) means *taro*, and [糕](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/糕) is *cake*, so [芋頭糕](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/芋頭糕) is *taro cake*.",
