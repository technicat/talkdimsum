    "description": "Similar to turnip cakes 蘿蔔糕 (lò baahk gōu) but made with taro mixed with rice flour and tidbits like Chinese sausage. It's cut into squares and steamed or pan-fried.\n\n芋頭 means “taro“, while 糕 is “cake.”\n\nTaro cake is sometimes known as “yam cake” in Malaysia and Singapore, but it's not yam as in sweet potatoes, it's really taro.",
