    "description": "Refers to takeout (in Hong Kong, the British *takeaway* is the more common term) and delivery food. Now more than ever, Chinese restaurants advertise takeout and delivery options, and Asian grocery stores often have takeout dim sum.\n\n**Characters**\n\n{外} is *outside*, and {賣} is *sell* (also the second character in [siu mai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shumai) {燒賣}.\n\nThere are other ways to specify takeout depending on context and region, for example {拎走} (līng jáu) is literally *carry to go*, {帶走} (daai jáu) is *bring to go*, and {打包} (dá bāau, same {包} as all the [bao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baozi)) generally means “to wrap” or “to pack” (literally “tie up in a bag”) and is how you'd ask to bag up leftovers.",
