It is prepared (steamed or pan-fried) soon after harvesting and before fermentation (oxidation) takes place and is lightly caffeinated.\n\n綠 means “green“ and 茶 is “tea,” so the first character 綠 means“green“ and the second character 茶 means “tea,” and 綠茶 is “green tea.”\n\nGreen tea is the most widely produced tea in China, with many varieties, such as Dragon Well, Biluochun, and Gunpowder.",
