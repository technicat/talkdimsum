        "description": "Earl Grey is an English tea (though legend has it that it was a Chinese gift to the second Earl of Grey, Charles Grey), flavored with oil of [bergamot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergamot_orange), an orange-like citrus grown in France and Italy. Earl Grey is one of the more popular teas in the West and occasionally can be found as an option in dim sum restaurants. And of course, it is the favorite tea of [Jean-Luc Picard](https://www.startrek.com/database_article/earl-grey-tea).\n\n**Characters**\n\n{伯爵} is a British earl, and {茶} is [tea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea), so {伯爵茶} is *earl tea*.",
