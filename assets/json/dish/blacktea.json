        "description": "[Black tea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_tea) is one of the more fermented and stronger-tasting teas. The tea was called “black tea” by European traders, who named it after the color of the leaves, although the brewed tea has a reddish hue (and in Chinese is called *red tea*, while *black tea* in Chinese refers to post-fermented teas like Pu'er tea).\n\n**Origin Story**\n\nBlack tea was invented relatively recently in the seventeenth century. according to legend, after traveling soldiers interrupted production at a tea factory, prompting the producers to dry the leaves over pine-cone fires.\n\n**Characters**\n\nThe first character [紅](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/紅) means *red*, and the second character [茶](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/茶) means *tea*, so [紅茶](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/紅茶) means *red tea*.\n\nIn Japanese, the kanji 紅茶 refers to non-Japanese tea.",
