        "Description": "Black tea is one of the more fermented and stronger-tasting teas. Chinese black tea actually has a reddish hue, so the first character 紅 means “red,” and the second character 茶 means “tea,” and 紅茶 literally means “red tea” (the literal Chinese for “black tea” actually refers to post-fermented teas like Pu'er tea).\n\nThe tea was called “black tea” by European traders, who named it after the color of the leaves. Black tea was invented relatively recently in the seventeenth centure, according to legend, after traveling soldiers interrupted production at a tea factory, prompting the producers to dry the leaves over pine-cone fires.",
