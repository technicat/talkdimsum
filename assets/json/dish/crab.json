    "description": "Crab claws with the meat exposed, covered in shrimp paste, breaded and deep fried. The claw pincers retain their shell and act as a handle. Like a crab popsicle.\n\n**Characters**\n\n[炸](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%82%B8) is *deep-fried*, [蟹](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%9F%B9) is *crab*, and [鉗] is (crustacean) [claw](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%89%97) (also the word for *pliers*). So 炸蟹鉗 is *deep-fried crab claw*.",
