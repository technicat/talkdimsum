        "description": "Rice porridge, also known as [congee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congee) (originating from the Tamil word for rice porridge, *kanji*) or *jook* (the Cantonese pronunciation), is prepared by boiling rice in water for a long time, until the rice is thick and soft.\n\nA staple of Chinese breakfasts (and popular throughout Asia) it can be served plain or include ingredients such as beef, fish, or pork and preserved egg.\n\n**Personal Taste**\n\nI like to mix half jasmine and half glutinous rice (a tip I found on the web but I don't remember where) for a nice thick texture, and put in fermented tofu, [pork sung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rousong), [soy eggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soy_egg) or just boiled eggs, and maybe throw in some peanuts.\n\n**Books*\n\nIn The Wisdom of the Chinese Kitchen, Grace Young explains that congee is one of the harmonizing soups, and in [Chinese Soul Food](https://mychinesesoulfood.com/vegetarian-chinese-soul-food/) by [Hsiao-Ching Chou](https://mychinesesoulfood.com/about/) describes how you can make congee from the leftover rice stuck at the bottom of your pot.\n\n[Fuschia Dunlop](http://www.fuchsiadunlop.com/) in Every Grain of Rice relates that {煲電話粥} (bōu dihn wá jūk in Cantonese, bāo diàn huà zhōu in Mandarin), literally [cooking telephone congee](https://zolimacitymag.com/cooking-telephone-congee/), is slang for a long telephone conversation. {煲} is *to cook*, {電話} is *telephone*, and {粥} is [congee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congee).",
