    "Description": "*Dim sum* are shared small dishes or steamer baskets of dumplings and other typically bite-sized foods.\n\nDim sum dishes originated from all over China and some even have Western influences, but dim sum as a Hong Kong and Cantonese cuisine (The English spelling is close to the Cantonese pronunciation *dím sām*) originated in the *yum cha* (drink tea) tradition of travelers stopping at teahouses for tea and snacks.\n\nDim sum is known for being served in on carts in large restaurants, but these days it can be found in a variety of settings ranging from banquet-sized restaurants to cozier Hong Kong-style cafes (cha chaan teng) and ordered off a menu.\n\n**Characters**\n\nThe first character 點 means *a little bit* and the second character 心 means *heart*, so it can be translated *a touch of heart* or *touching the heart* (the origin of the term is debated).\n\nRhymes with “Be careful!” (小心 síu sām), “happy” (開心 hōi sām) and the vegetable “choy sum” (菜心 choi sām).\n\n**Notes**",
