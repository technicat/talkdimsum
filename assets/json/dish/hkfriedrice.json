    "description": "A [cha chaan teng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cha_chaan_teng) classic, emblematic of Hong Kong's Chinese-Western fusion cuisine, this is baked pork chop on a bed of egg fried rice, surrounded by tomato sauce and topped with cheese.\n\n**Personal Note**\n\nI had this frequently in my workplace cafeteria during a stint in Hong Kong, so I was excited to see this on the menu at a restaurant in the US, but when I asked for “baked pork chop on rice” as it was listed on the menu, they said “We don't have baked pork chop on rice.” Then I asked for “jyū pàh faahn” (pork chop rice in Cantonese), and they said OK. So it pays to learn the language.\n\n**Characters**\n\n{焗} is *baked*, {豬扒} is *pork chop* or *pork cutlet*, and {飯} is *rice* (cooked), so 焗豬扒飯 is *baked pork chop rice*.",
