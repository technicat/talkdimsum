That second character {龍} is also the first character for lobster ({龍蝦} lùhng hā), *dragon shrimp*.\n\n**Origin Stories**\n\nThere are a few origin stories for the name (literally *black dragon*). One is that oolong tea evolved from a Dragon-Phoenix tribute tea and later renamed Black Dragon. Another theory for the name is that oolong tea first existed in the Wuyi Mountains region. Another story is that the tea was discovered by a man named Wu Liang, who accidentally let the tea leaves ferment (after getting distracted by a deer)."
