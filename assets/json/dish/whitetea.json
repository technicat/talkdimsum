    "description": "A light, minimally processed, tea made from leaves harvested traditionally in Fujian, dating back at least as long ago as the Song Dynasty. White tea is harvested in the spring, when the the buds are still unopened and covered with white hairs, hence the name. The main varieties of white tea are [white peony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bai_Mudan), [silver needle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baihao_Yinzhen), [sau mei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoumei_tea) (otherwise known as *longevity eyebrows*), and [gong-mei](https://teapedia.org/en/Gong_Mei) (otherwise known as *tribute eyebrows*).\n\n**Preparation**\n\nAs white tea leaves are more delicate and less oxidized, they can be steeped in lower temperature water than the darker teas, 185-210 degrees Fahrenheit according to Simon Beckwith in [A Little Tea Book](https://inpursuitoftea.com/products/little-tea-book).\n\n**Characters**\n\n[白](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%99%BD) is *white*, and [茶](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E8%8C%B6) is [tea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea)., so [白茶](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%99%BD%E8%8C%B6) is *white tea*.",
