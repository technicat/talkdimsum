Jasmine and oolong tea is standard, and chrysanthemum is a common non-caffeinated option, but large Chinese restaurants usually offer many more (I once asked “what tea do you have?” and they responded “what do you want?”\n\n**Books**\n\n[A Little Tea Book](https://inpursuitoftea.com/products/little-tea-book) by Simon Beckwith describes the varieties of teas (not just Chinese), their characteristics, and proper preparation. [The Dim Sum Field Guide](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/533493/the-dim-sum-field-guide-by-carolyn-phillips/) by Carolyn Phillips lists teas commonly served with dim sum.",
