      "description": "[Wonton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonton) are typically deep-fried or boiled and served in soup. The literal translation *cloud swallows* alludes to how the wonton float in soup with the skin billowing (according to Grace Young in The Wisdom of the Chinese Kitchen, wontons made correctly should be “heavenly morsels”).\n\n**Cooking Tips**\n\nYou can buy wonton skins (squares) from Asian grocery stores.\n\n**Characters**\n\nThe characters [雲吞](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E9%9B%B2%E5%90%9E) for [wonton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonton) literally mean *cloud swallows* which is a nice rebranding -- long ago the name evolved from 餛飩 which is pronounced the same in Cantonese and means *chaos*, alluding to how wonton was enclosed without a way to breathe.",
