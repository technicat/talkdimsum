    "Description": "[Soy sauce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soy_sauce) is brewed from fermented soybean paste.\n\n**History**\n\nSoy sauce originated in China over two thousand years ago as a way to stretch the use of salt (a prized commodity in ancient China, heavily taxed and smuggled).\n\n[豉](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/豉) means *salted fermented beans* and [油](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/油) is *oil*, so 豉油 is *salted fermented bean oil*.",

    "Description": "[Sesame oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_oil) is made from toasted sesame seeds.\n\n**Tips**\n\nWhen shopping, look for pure sesame oil, not blended, and not cold pressed sesame oil. When cooking, apply sesame oil at the end or after just before serving, as high temperature destroys the flavor.\n\n**Characters**\n\n[香](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/香) means *fragrant* (the same 香 used in *Hong Kong*, [香港](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/香港)), and [油](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/油) is *oil* (the same 油 used in *soy sauce*, 豉油), so [香油](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/香油) is *sesame oil*.",
