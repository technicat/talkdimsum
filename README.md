This is the flutter project for [Talk Dim Sum](http://talkdimsum.com) (download the Android build there)

The Swift version on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/talk-dim-sum/id953929066) has more features/polish than the Android build from this project but shares the same data (images and JSON)

Using the flutter dev channel so I can play with desktop app builds
